            This is a simple Angular and Node application to manage pizza data. The application replicates the functions of a waiter or an administrator at a hotel. You can add new pizza data, edit existing pizza data, and delete and reserve a pizza.
            To run the application, first, navigate to the folder 'api' and run the command 'node server.js.' Then in the root folder, run 'ng serve.'
            Make sure you have Node.js version 20.5.1 (latest) installed to run the application.
