            This is a simple Angular and Node application to manage pizza data. The application replicates the functions of a waiter or an administrator at a hotel. You can add new pizza data, Search, edit existing pizza data, and delete and reserve a pizza.
            To run the application, first, navigate to the folder 'api' and run the command 'node server.js.' Then in the root folder, run 'ng serve.'
           The application requires a minimum Node.js version of either v14.20, v16.14 or v18.10.
           Mongo Db must be installed for the application to work.
           The application does not have static data. All data will be added by the user from the GUI.
